## About
This repo will chronicle my attempt at porting Onion OS to the trimui brick. 

At the onset I only have curosory knowledge about how Onion installs and operates. My only real experience with these custom OSs 
- Building and running MinUI on the brick.
- Creating a pretty sweet [LED Controller app or the TrimUI Brick ](https://github.com/pierceTee/TrimuiLEDController).

I'll be doing my best to chronicle my findings here to helpfully aid in other devs trying to do the same.
